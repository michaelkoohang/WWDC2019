My submission to Apple's scholarship program for the 2019 World Wide Developer Conference. I was awarded one of 350 scholarships in the world to attend the conference.

The premise of the playground is to educate users on how the iPhone protects their privacy in a fun and ineractive way.

The playground was built using Xcode and UIKit.
